                        Novak Djokovic (born May 22, 1987, Belgrade, Serbia, Yugoslavia [now in Serbia]) is a Serbian tennis player who is one of the greatest men's players in the history of the game. His 24 Grand Slam singles titles—which includes an unprecedented 10 Australian Open championships—is a record for men. Djokovic is considered one of the game's best returners, and he is also known for his backhand shot as well as his physical endurance.

                <p class="content-text">
                    Djokovic began his professional career in 2003. In 2008, at age 20, he disrupted Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive majors by winning his first major title at the Australian Open. By 2010, Djokovic had begun to separate himself from the rest of the field and, as a result, the trio of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic was referred to as the "Big Three" among fans and commentators. In 2011, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first time, winning three majors and a then-record five Masters titles while going 10-1 against Nadal and Federer. He remained the most successful player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade. In 2015, Djokovic had his most successful season, reaching a single-season record 15 consecutive finals, winning a season-record 10 Big Titles while having a record 31 victories over the top-10 players. His dominant run extended through to the 2016 French Open, where he completed his first Career Grand Slam and a non-calendar year Grand Slam, becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four majors simultaneously and setting a rankings points record of 16,950.

                A favorite entering the 2024 Australian Open, Djokovic lost in the semifinals to Italy’s Jannik Sinner, ending his 33-match win streak at the tournament. Some five months later he competed at the French Open, where he tore the medial meniscus in his right knee in the round of 16. Although he won the match, he subsequently withdrew from the tournament. Following surgery and a quick recovery, Djokovic competed at Wimbledon, and he advanced to the finals, where he lost to Alcaraz. The two men met again in the gold medal match at the 2024 Paris Games, and this time Djokovic was victorious. With that win, he became the fifth tennis player to claim a career “Golden Slam” (winning the four major tournaments and an Olympic gold medal). A month after his Olympic victory, Djokovic entered the U.S. Open as the number two seed. However, he lost in the third round and later said it was “some of the worst tennis” he had ever played.
