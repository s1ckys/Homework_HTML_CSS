      Peaky Blinders is a British period crime drama television series created
      by Steven Knight. Set in Birmingham, it follows the exploits of the Peaky
      Blinders crime gang in the direct aftermath of the First World War. The
      fictional gang is loosely based on a real urban youth gang who were active
      in the city from the 1880s to the 1920s. It features an ensemble cast led
      by Cillian Murphy, starring as Tommy Shelby, Helen McCrory as Elizabeth
      "Polly" Gray, Paul Anderson as Arthur Shelby, Sophie Rundle as Ada Shelby,
      and Joe Cole as John Shelby, the gang's senior members. Sam Neill,
      Annabelle Wallis, Iddo Goldberg, Tom Hardy, Charlotte Riley, Finn Cole,
      Natasha O'Keeffe, Paddy Considine, Adrien Brody, Aidan Gillen, Anya
      Taylor-Joy, Sam Claflin, Amber Anderson, James Frecheville, and Stephen
      Graham also appeared in at least one episode of the series. The programme
      began on 12 September 2013, broadcast on BBC Two until the fourth series
      (with repeats on BBC Four), then moved to BBC One for the fifth and sixth
      series. Netflix, under a deal with Weinstein Company and Endemol, acquired
      the rights to release the show in the United States and around the world.
      In January 2021, it was announced that the sixth series would be the final
      series. The last series was broadcast in 2022. A feature-length film
      titled The Immortal Man, which is set a few years after the end of the
      series, began filming in September 2024 and will be distributed by
      Netflix.

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
      Peaky Blinders is a crime drama centred on a family of mixed Irish
      Traveller and Romani origins based in Birmingham, England, starting in
      1919, several months after the end of the First World War. It centres on
      the Peaky Blinders street gang and their ambitious, cunning crime boss
      Tommy Shelby. The gang comes to the attention of Major Chester Campbell, a
      detective chief inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary sent by Winston
      Churchill from Belfast, where he had been sent to clean up the city of the
      Irish Republican Army flying columns, the Communist Party of Great
      Britain, street gangs, and common criminals.[1][2] Winston Churchill
      (played by Andy Nyman in series 1 and Richard McCabe in series 2) charges
      him with suppressing disorder and uprising in Birmingham and recovering a
      stolen cache of arms and ammunition meant to be shipped to Libya.[3][4]
      The first series concludes on 3 December 1919â€”"Black Star Day", the event
      where the Peaky Blinders plan to take over Billy Kimber's betting pitches
      at the Worcester Races. The second series has the Peaky Blinders expand
      their criminal organisation in the "South and North while maintaining a
      stronghold in their Birmingham heartland".[5] It begins in 1921 and ends
      with a climax at Epsom racecourse on 31 May 1922, Derby Day.[6] The third
      series takes place in 1924, following Tommy and the gang as they enter an
      even more dangerous world by expanding once again, this time
      internationally. The third series also features Father John Hughes (Paddy
      Considine), who is involved in an anti-communist organization; Ruben
      Oliver (Alexander Siddig), a painter whom Polly enlists to paint her
      portrait; Russian Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna (Gaite Jansen); and Linda
      Shelby (Kate Phillips), the new wife of Arthur. The fourth series begins
      on Christmas Eve 1925, with the Peaky Blinders getting word that the New
      York Mafia, led by Luca Changretta (Adrien Brody), is coming to avenge the
      murder of his father, committed the previous series and ends following the
      general strike of May 1926, with Tommy using communist leader Jessie Eden
      for information and being elected as a Member of Parliament in 1927. The
      fifth series runs two years later, from 29 October 1929 (Black Tuesday) to
      7 December 1929, the morning after a rally led by Sir Oswald Mosley. The
      sixth series begins on 5 December 1933, as prohibition is repealed in the
      United States. The Nazi Party has obtained power in Germany, leading to a
      growth in membership of Mosley's British Union of Fascists. Tommy must not
      only deal with Mosley but also with plots from the Irish Mob as well as
      the Anti-Treaty IRA.
