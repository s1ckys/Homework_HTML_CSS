      Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for
      the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series premiered on January 31, 1999,
      following Super Bowl XXXIII, with the rest of the first season airing from
      April 11, 1999. The show centers around the Griffins, a dysfunctional
      family consisting of parents Peter and Lois, their children, Meg, Chris,
      and Stewie, and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. Set in the fictional
      city of Quahog, Rhode Island, the show exhibits much of its humor in the
      form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.
      The family was conceived by MacFarlane after he developed two animated
      films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the
      films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and
      Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in
      December 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Family
      Guy's cancellation was announced shortly after the third season had aired
      in 2002, with one unaired episode eventually premiering on Adult Swim in
      2003, finishing the series' original run. Favorable DVD sales and high
      ratings from syndicated reruns since then convinced Fox to revive the show
      in 2004; a fourth season began airing the following year, on May 1, 2005.
      Since its premiere, Family Guy has received generally positive reviews. In
      2009, it was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy
      Series, the first time an animated series had been nominated for the award
      since The Flintstones in 1961. In 2013, TV Guide ranked Family Guy as the
      ninth-greatest TV cartoon. The series has also garnered considerable
      amounts of criticism and controversy, ranging from storylines and
      character stereotypes, to allegations of racism, homophobia, and misogyny.
      Many tie-in media based on the show have been released, including Stewie
      Griffin: The Untold Story, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005;
      Family Guy: Live in Vegas, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005,
      featuring music from the show as well as music created by MacFarlane and
      Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and
      2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult; and
      Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010), a collection of
      three episodes parodying the original Star Wars trilogy. A spin-off
      series, The Cleveland Show, featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from
      September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013. On January 26, 2023, Fox announced
      that the series had been renewed for seasons 22 and 23, taking the show
      through the 2024â€“25 television season. Season 22 premiered on October 1,
      2023. Family Guy moved to Wednesday nights beginning March 6, 2024,
      marking the show's first weeknight airings since 2002.

    <h3>Premise</h3>
    <p>
      The show centers around the adventures and activities of the dysfunctional
      Griffin family, consisting of father Peter Griffin, a bumbling and clumsy
      yet well-intentioned blue-collar worker; his wife Lois, a stay-at-home
      mother and piano teacher (in early episodes) who is a member of the
      affluent Pewterschmidt family; Meg, their often bullied teenage daughter
      who is constantly ridiculed or ignored by the family; Chris, their awkward
      teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent, unathletic, and in many
      respects a younger version of his father; and Stewie, their diabolical
      infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who is an adult-mannered evil
      genius and uses stereotypical archvillain phrases. Living with the family
      is their witty, smoking, martini-swilling, sarcastic, English-speaking
      anthropomorphic dog Brian, although he is still considered a pet in many
      ways. Recurring characters appear alongside the Griffin family. These
      include the family's neighbors: sex-crazed airline pilot bachelor Glenn
      Quagmire; deli owner/mail carrier Cleveland Brown and his wife Loretta
      (later Donna); paraplegic police officer Joe Swanson, his wife Bonnie,
      their son Kevin and their baby daughter Susie; neurotic Jewish pharmacist
      Mort Goldman, his wife Muriel, and their geeky and annoying son Neil, and
      elderly child molester Herbert. TV news anchors Tom Tucker and Diane
      Simmons, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, and Blaccu-Weather meteorologist
      Ollie Williams also make frequent appearances. Actor James Woods guest
      stars as himself in multiple episodes, as did Adam West, prior to his
      death.
