      The Godfather is a 1972 American epic gangster film directed by Francis
      Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's
      best-selling 1969 novel. The film stars an ensemble cast including Marlon
      Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling
      Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte and Diane Keaton. It is the first
      installment in The Godfather trilogy, chronicling the Corleone family
      under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando) from 1945 to 1955. It focuses on
      the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from
      reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss. Paramount Pictures
      obtained the rights to the novel for $80,000, before it gained popularity.
      Studio executives had trouble finding a director; the first few candidates
      turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film but
      disagreement followed over casting several characters, in particular, Vito
      (Brando) and Michael (Pacino). Filming took place primarily in locations
      around New York City and Sicily, and it was completed ahead of schedule.
      The score was composed principally by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by
      Carmine Coppola. The Godfather premiered at the Loew's State Theatre on
      March 14, 1972, and was widely released in the United States on March 24,
      1972. It was the highest-grossing film of 1972, and was for a time the
      highest-grossing film ever made, earning between $250 and $291 million at
      the box office. The film was acclaimed by critics and audiences, who
      praised its performances—particularly those of Brando and
      Pacino—direction, screenplay, story, cinematography, editing, score and
      portrayal of the mafia. The Godfather launched the successful careers of
      Coppola, Pacino and other relative newcomers in the cast and crew. At the
      45th Academy Awards, the film won Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and
      Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven
      other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan and Duvall, all for Best
      Supporting Actor, and Coppola for Best Director. The Godfather is regarded
      as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, as well as a
      landmark of the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the
      U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990, being
      deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and is
      ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane)
      by the American Film Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather
      Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990). Pauline Kael wrote that
      "If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come out
      of a merger of commerce and art, The Godfather is it."

    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <p>
      In 1945, the New York City Corleone family don, Vito Corleone, listens to
      requests during his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo Rizzi. Vito's
      youngest son Michael, a Marine who has thus far stayed out of the family
      business, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the
      reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks
      Vito's help in securing a movie role. Vito sends his consigliere, Tom
      Hagen, to persuade studio president Jack Woltz to offer Johnny the part.
      Woltz refuses Hagen's request at first, but soon complies after finding
      the severed head of his prized stud horse in his bed. As Christmas
      approaches, drug baron Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in
      his narcotics business and for police protection. Vito declines, citing
      that involvement in narcotics would alienate his political connections.
      Suspicious of Sollozzo's partnership with the Tattaglia crime family, Vito
      sends his enforcer Luca Brasi to the Tattaglias on an espionage mission.
      Brasi is garroted to death during the initial meeting. Later, enforcers
      gun down Vito and coerce Hagen into a meeting. With Vito's first-born
      Sonny now in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept
      the narcotics deal. Vito survives the shooting and is visited in the
      hospital by Michael, who finds him unprotected after NYPD officers on
      Sollozzo's payroll clear out Vito's guards. Michael thwarts the attempt on
      his father's life but is beaten by corrupt police captain Mark McCluskey.
      After the attempted hit at the hospital, Sonny retaliates with a hit on
      Bruno Tattaglia. Sollozzo and McCluskey request to meet with Michael and
      settle the dispute. Michael feigns interest and agrees to meet, but
      hatches a plan with Sonny and Corleone capo Clemenza to kill them and go
      into hiding. Michael meets Sollozzo and McCluskey at a Bronx restaurant;
      after retrieving a handgun planted in the bathroom by Clemenza, he shoots
      both men dead. Despite a clampdown by the authorities for the killing of a
      police captain, the Five Families erupt in open warfare. Michael takes
      refuge in Sicily and Fredo, Vito's second son, is sheltered by Moe Greene
      in Las Vegas. In Sicily, Michael meets and marries a local woman,
      Apollonia. Sonny publicly attacks and threatens Carlo for physically
      abusing Connie. When he abuses her again, Sonny speeds to their home but
      is ambushed and murdered by gangsters at a highway toll booth. Apollonia
      is killed shortly thereafter by a car bomb intended for Michael.
      Devastated by Sonny's death and tired of war, Vito sets a meeting with the
      Five Families. He assures them that he will withdraw his opposition to
      their narcotics business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety
      guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry
      Kay. Kay gives birth to two children in the early 1950s. With his father
      nearing the end of his life and Fredo not suited to lead, Michael assumes
      the position of head of the Corleone family. Vito reveals to Michael that
      it was Don Barzini who ordered the hit on Sonny and warns him that Barzini
      would try to kill him at a meeting organized by a traitorous Corleone
      capo. With Vito's support, Michael relegates Hagen to managing operations
      in Las Vegas as he is not a "wartime consigliere". Michael travels to Las
      Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos and is dismayed to
      see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family. In 1955,
      Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with Michael's son Anthony. At
      Vito's funeral, Tessio asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling his
      betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's
      baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone
      hitmen murder the dons of the Five Families, in addition to Greene for not
      selling his hotel and Tessio for betraying Michael. Michael extracts
      Carlo's confession for his involvement in Sonny's murder. He assures Carlo
      that he is being exiled, not murdered. However, Clemenza strangles Carlo
      in a car moments after his confession. Connie confronts Michael about his
      involvement in Carlo's death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if
      he ordered Carlo's death and is relieved when he denies responsibility. As
      she leaves, capos enter the office and pay reverence to Michael as "Don
      Corleone".
